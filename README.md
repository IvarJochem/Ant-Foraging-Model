# Ant-Foraging-Model
All files are run using Python (3.11.9)
Required libraries are: numpy (1.26.4), matplotlib (3.8.4) and pandas (2.2.3)
ant_model_walkback will run one simulation with a visual
headless_simulation will run multiple simulation with different parameters and output results in the sim_results folder
Visualizations will generate graphs of the data in sim_results
graph_npaths_vs_time will run simulations with different number of paths and create a window with a graph based on the results of the simulations
maze_generator_with_nPaths will generate and print a maze to the console
In all the files you can modify the parameters inside the files to get different results
